## structure


* In this repo we will cover all codes and revision needed for quick brush up for concepts.
* so that when we need to visit the concepts,its available for us.

_The Structure is like_
1. Conditional statements
  1.1 If loop
  1.2 for loop
  1.3 while loop
  
2.Strings 

3.Reading files
4. functions and variables
5. functions and files
6.memorizing logic
7. 


1. Conditional statements<br>
1.1 If else Loop: 
       
       ```  
       password = raw_input("Enter the password")
       if password =="MI6":
          print("welcome Mr.bond")
       else: 
          print("access denied")    
       ```
Let's check what is if...else loop.
  ```py
  if condition-1:
        sequence of statements-1
  elif condition-n:
        sequence of statements-n
  else:
        default sequence of statements
  ```

Now, let's try to put college grades into use and understand how we can put the grades
through programming:
